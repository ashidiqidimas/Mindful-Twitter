# Mindful-Twitter
Do you find yourself mindlessly scrolling on Twitter for hours? Mindful Twitter is here to help.

Mindful Twitter will remind you to pause and do a short mindfulness session whenever it detects that you have been scrolling on Twitter for an extended period of time.

I spend a lot of time on Twitter and find myself trapped in the infamous “infinite scroll” over and over again. I believe most of us also trapped in this situation without we even realize. So I created Mindful Twitter that will help you to #TakeBackYourInternet.

When it detects that you have been scrolling for a long time, it will show a pop up and ask you to do a short mindfulness session. This pop up will guide you to do mindful breathing two times. When you finish, the pop up will disappear. After you scroll again for a long time, the pop up will reappear.
